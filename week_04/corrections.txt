Kristi's suggestions:
1.  add something to help with the "endless scrolling"
----unfortunately something fancy to help with this is beyond the scope of my current coding skills; will instead offer a fixed side navigation to return to top----
2.  add hover effect on main navigation for desktop views
----agree; if site were viewed on destkop, hover option is helpful----
3.  utilize <main> instead of <div> for page-wrap
----chose to not implement as the use of <div> in this context is more appropriate for formatting and containing the news posts and footer----
4.  try to keep search button on same line as search field
----chose to not implement as fastnav takes up too much space----
5.  move menu icon to top right of viewport
----chose to not implement as its alignment is based on its relation to the convention's logo, aiming for an aesthetically pleasing appearance----

Sandra's suggestion:
1.  add some kind of branding/design elements to help identify site as Anime Boston

Brigit's suggestions:
